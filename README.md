# reminder_app
Reminder app is a simple reminder application with built in notification system.

# Introduction
This application let's user set a reminder with a custom text and and timespan of their choosing. In order to store the reminders and keep them even when the app is killed, i used HIVE package. Hive is a noSQL database that integrates with Flutter. For listening notifications and controlling their behaviours, i used RxDart package. To set the time for the notifications , i used intl package and to hold the data at cache and pass it to database , i used provider package. Lastly, to add more styling to the app i used Google Fonts package.
